# Competitive programming

A simple environment for compiling and running competitive programming.

This is also where I dump all my solutions.

## Compiling

You will need:
- A C++11 compiler
- GNU make

```
make
```

This will precompile `bits/stdc++.h` for faster compilation and compile all
source files into their respective binaries.
